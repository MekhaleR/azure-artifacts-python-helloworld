# The project package is built into `dist/` by running:
#
#   python -m build
#
# Then install the generated wheel with either:
#
#   pip install dist/*.whl
#
# or, if you want `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the
# package, first build the distribution so `dist/` exists.

# Local package dependency removed to avoid install-time errors when
# `dist/` is not present. Uncomment and adjust the following line
# if you intentionally want pip to install the local wheel from `dist/`:
# azurehello @ file:./dist
